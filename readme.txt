Opens all external links in a new window. XHTML Strict compliant and search engine optimized (SEO).

== Description ==
Opens all external links (starting with "http://" or "https://") in a separate browser window.
The plugin produces XHTML Strict compliant code and is also search engine optimized (SEO).

This is done using the javascript:window.open()-function.

Most other plugins perform a hack by altering the "target" parameter (i.e. `<a href="http://somewhere.example" target="_blank">`).
This plugin handles the links client-side, which lets search engines follow the links properly. Also, if a browser does not support JavaScript, the plugin is simply inactive, and does not result in any errors.
